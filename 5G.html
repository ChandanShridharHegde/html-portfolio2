<p>In March 2019, South Korea became the first country to offer 5G, with telecom providers KT, LG Uplus, and SK Telecom leading the rollout. Since then, 5G has been introduced in major cities across Canada, marking the dawn of a new era in mobile technology.

Experts predict that 5G will be up to 20 times faster than 4G. In Canada, the median 5G download speed is already 169.46 Mbps, which is 205% faster than the typical 4G speeds. But speed isn't the only advantageâ€”5G also offers significantly reduced latency and increased bandwidth.
<ol>
<li>Latency: 5G drastically reduces latency, which enhances download and upload speeds. While 4G typically has an average latency of around 50 milliseconds, 5G's latency is expected to average around 10 milliseconds, with the potential to drop as low as 1 millisecond.</li><br>

<li>Bandwidth: 5G operates within a larger frequency range, between 30 GHz and 300 GHz, allowing it to support more devices and technologies. This expanded capacity is crucial for mass IoT deployments, such as smart cities and other connected industries.</li><br>
</ol>
5G's potential has not been without controversy, though. Some concerns have been raised, including whether electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) could pose a threat to 5G deployment.

As the battle for the best smartphone continues into the 5G era, new models like the BlackBerry Key2 are emerging. The question remains whether BlackBerry can make a comeback with its new 5G phone.</p>
