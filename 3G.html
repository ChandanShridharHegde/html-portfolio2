<p>In 2001, NTT DoCoMo deployed 3G for public use in Japan, marking another pivotal moment in the evolution of mobile technology. The key focus of 3G was on standardizing vendors’ network protocols, which allowed users to access data from virtually anywhere and introduced international roaming services.

    3G's capabilities far surpassed those of its predecessor, 2G, with four times the data transfer speed, reaching up to 2 Mbps on average. This increase in speed enabled a host of new possibilities:
    <ul></ul>
   <li> Video streaming, video conferences, and live video chat (think back to the early days of Skype) became feasible, making real-time visual communication a reality.</li><br>
<li> Emails became a standard form of communication on mobile devices, reflecting the growing reliance on mobile for business and personal correspondence.</li><br>
<li>   Internet browsing became practical on mobile devices, with users able to surf basic HTML pages.</li><br>
<li>   Music streaming on the go also became possible, setting the stage for the mobile entertainment era.</li><br>
</ul>
    While 2G had offered some of these features, 3G brought them to life with much faster download speeds and broader support.
    
    As 3G networks expanded and improved, download speeds increased further. For example, in Canada, 3G download speeds reached nearly 6 Mbps, significantly enhancing the mobile internet experience.
    
    During the 3G era, traditional "candy bar" and flip phones were still popular, but a new contender emerged: the smartphone. These devices offered a suite of features, including calling, texting, internet browsing, and music streaming, all in one device. The smartphone market was dominated by two major competitors—BlackBerry and Apple.
    <ul>
    <li>BlackBerry launched its first mobile device, the BlackBerry 5810, in 2002. This smartphone came with a full keyboard, advanced security features, a calendar, music capabilities, and internet access, though oddly, calls had to be made through a headset.</li><br>
    
    <li>In 2007, Apple introduced the original iPhone, which quickly began to dominate the smartphone and cellphone market. By 2008, the release of the iPhone 3G (also known as the iPhone 2) set a new standard for mobile devices. The demand for Apple's groundbreaking phone was so high that 1 million iPhone 3Gs were sold during the opening weekend alone. By 2017, BlackBerry's market share had dwindled to 0%, underscoring the iPhone's transformative impact.</li></ul></p>
