<p>Introduced for commercial use in Norway at the end of 2009, 4G revolutionized mobile technology by offering the high-speed services we rely on today. With a starting speed of 12.5 Mbps, 4G enabled high-quality video streaming and chat, fast mobile web access, HD videos, and online gaming. Unlike the transition from 2G to 3G, which only required a SIM card switch, mobile devices needed to be specifically designed to support 4G.

    However, the early days of 4G were marked by a bit of a technicality. When the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) set the required minimum speeds for 4G at 12.5 Mbps, technology hadn't yet caught up to meet that benchmark. But given the significant investments by tech manufacturers to achieve this standard, the ITU-R allowed LTE (Long-Term Evolution) to be labeled as 4G, provided it offered a substantial improvement over 3G. In reality, early 4G networks were closer to 3.9G or 3.95G in terms of performance. Today, however, this is no longer an issue, as true 4G speeds have become the norm.
    <br>
    By mid-2011, Canada launched its first LTE wireless network in Ottawa, Ontario, courtesy of Rogers, offering speeds just below 12.5 Mbps and labeling it 4G LTE. Over time, these speeds have improved significantly. By 2020, Canada's median 4G download speed had reached 55.5 Mbps, reflecting the evolution and enhancement of the network.
    
    During the 4G era, some of the best-selling cellphones included the iPhone 6 and the Samsung Galaxy S4. 
    <ul>
     <li>The iPhone 6 became Apple's best-selling smartphone to date, with 22.4 million units sold.</li><br>
    <li>The Samsung Galaxy S4 was a popular choice as well, becoming the best-selling Android-powered mobile phone ever, with 80 million units sold worldwide.</li>
</ul>
    Since its introduction in 2009, 4G has nearly reached its capacity in terms of data transfer speeds. As new technologies emerge at an accelerating pace, the world is now looking toward even faster networks to meet future demands, paving the way for 5G.</p>
