<p>Building on the foundation laid by 1G, the second generation of wireless technology, 2G, was launched on the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) in Finland in 1991. This marked a significant leap forward in mobile communication.

    2G introduced several critical advancements:
    <ul>
   <li> Encrypted calls ensured that conversations were secure, preventing unauthorized eavesdropping.</li><br>
<li> Improved sound quality made conversations clearer, reducing the static and crackling noises that were common with 1G.</li><br>
<li> Faster download speeds—although still slow by today's standards—averaged around 0.2 Mbps, a considerable improvement over 1G.</li><br>
</ul>
    One of the most groundbreaking features of 2G was its ability to transfer data between phones, enabling users to access media content such as ringtones. This data transfer capability also laid the groundwork for basic smartphone functionality. However, the most transformative aspect of 2G's data transfer was the introduction of Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), which fundamentally changed how people communicated. Text and multimedia messages were sent in packets of data from one phone to a tower and then on to the recipient's phone, using the same control channels as voice calls.
    
    During the 2G era, "candy bar phones" became extremely popular, with Nokia leading the charge. One of the most iconic phones of this time was the Nokia 3210, which sold over 160 million units. Its design, durability, and user-friendly interface made it a favorite among consumers.
    
    As 2G made texting, downloading, and talking over the phone more accessible and widespread, it spurred massive adoption of cell phones across both consumer and business markets. However, as more people started using mobile phones, the demand for data grew exponentially, setting the stage for the next generation of mobile technology.</p>
