<p>1G, the first generation of wireless cellular technology, was launched by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in Tokyo in 1979. By 1984, it had expanded to cover all of Japan, making it the first country with nationwide 1G service. The United States followed in March 1983 when Ameritech introduced 1G, with Canada joining the ranks by the mid-1980s.

    Although a cellphone prototype had been developed as early as 1973, it wasn't until 1983 that Motorola introduced the first commercially available cellphone, the DynaTAC, to the public. Weighing 2 pounds, the Motorola DynaTAC, often nicknamed “The Brick,” offered 30 minutes of talk time and took about 10 hours to charge. Priced at USD 3,995 (equivalent to about USD 10,300 today), the DynaTAC was bulky and awkward to use, yet its sales exceeded expectations. Ameritech sold roughly 1,200 units in the first year alone. By 1998, cellphones and related services accounted for two-thirds of Motorola’s revenues.
    
    Despite being revolutionary for its time, 1G had significant limitations by today's standards. Call quality was poor, with low sound quality and frequent static and background noise. Coverage was inconsistent, and the network offered no roaming support. Security was also a major issue, as 1G channels were not encrypted, allowing anyone with a radio scanner to eavesdrop on calls. Additionally, download speeds were extremely slow, reaching only around 2.4 kbps.
    
    While 1G was a groundbreaking step forward, it left plenty of room for improvement. Interestingly, according to Wikipedia, Russia is the only country still operating a 1G cellular network today.</p>
