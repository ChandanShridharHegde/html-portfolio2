<p>6G is expected to build upon the foundation laid by 5G, offering even faster speeds, lower latency, and greater capacity. While 5G can deliver speeds up to 20 Gbps, 6G is anticipated to reach speeds of up to 1 Tbps (terabit per second). This leap in performance could enable truly instantaneous communication and seamless integration of advanced technologies into everyday life.

      <li> Terahertz Frequency Bands: 6G is likely to operate in the terahertz frequency range (300 GHz to 3 THz), significantly expanding the available bandwidth. This would allow for incredibly high data transfer rates and the support of an even larger number of connected devices.</li> <br>

    <li> Ultra-Low Latency: With 5G already reducing latency to as low as 1 millisecond, 6G aims to push this even further, potentially achieving latency in the microsecond range. This would enable real-time applications on an unprecedented scale, such as advanced augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and even brain-computer interfaces.</li> <br>

    <li> AI-Driven Networks: 6G networks are expected to be heavily integrated with artificial intelligence, making them more adaptive, efficient, and capable of self-optimization. AI could manage network resources dynamically, ensuring optimal performance based on current demand and conditions.</li><br>

    <li> Massive IoT Expansion: 6G will further expand the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, connecting billions of devices in smart cities, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, agriculture, and more. The enhanced capabilities of 6G could make large-scale IoT deployments more feasible and efficient than ever before.</li><br>

    <li> Enhanced Security and Privacy: As data transmission becomes even faster and more ubiquitous, 6G will need to incorporate advanced security protocols to protect sensitive information. This might include quantum encryption and other cutting-edge technologies to ensure privacy and data integrity.</li><br>
